# Assignment 4 – Comparison of Normal Distributions

##  Title
Comparison of Normal Distributions with Different Standard Deviations

##  Description
This assignment compares three normal distributions having the same mean
but different standard deviations.

Given values:

- Mean (μ) = 55
- Standard deviations: 4, 10 and 15

The assignment explains:

- Effect of standard deviation on the shape of the curve
- Properties of normal distribution
- Empirical rule for each case
- Variance comparison
- Stability and predictability of distributions
- Graphical interpretation
- Real-world examples
